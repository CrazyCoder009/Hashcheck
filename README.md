# Hashcheck

Hashcheck is a simple bash script that checks the md5 hash of any file for security.

## How is this working?
Everytime you modify a file a new md5hash is generated for it.
You can use this script to check for md5hash of any file and compare it.

## How to run the script:

1. Clone or Copy the script.

2. bash icheck.sh [filename] [The md5hash you need to check against]

eg: 
bash icheck.sh example_file.txt 9e5ff423ca31c4e4236f137d1081ff1a
